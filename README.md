DRYResponder
============

[![DRYResponder build status](https://travis-ci.org/appfoundry/DRYResponder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/appfoundry/DRYResponder)   [![CocoaPods Version](https://cocoapod-badges.herokuapp.com/v/DRYResponder/badge.png)](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/DRYResponder/)

This project holds our very light-weight callhandle and responder framework for asynchronous communication, typically between an app and a backend system.

DRYResponder is described in the remoting architecture talk, presented at AppFoundry by Mike Seghers & Filip Maelbrancke. (http://parleys.com/play/517a9286e4b0c6dcd9546458)
